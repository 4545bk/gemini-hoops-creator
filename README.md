## 🛠️ Getting Started (Local Development)

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/4545bk/gemini-hoops-creator.git

# 2. Change directory
cd gemini-hoops-creator

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start dev server with hot reload
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever your Vite dev server port is) to view the app locally.

---

## 📦 Build & Deployment

To build a production-ready bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then you can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host (e.g. Vercel, Netlify, etc). If using Vercel, it should detect the config automatically.

---

## 🔧 Configuration & Environment Variables

If your project uses any environment variables (e.g. API keys, endpoints, etc.), make sure you have a `.env` file (or `.env.local`) with the necessary keys. Example:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
OTHER_KEY=some_value
```

Include `.env.example` in the repo showing what variables are needed (without real secrets).

---

## 🧩 Features & Usage

* Live preview of hoop designs
* Customization of parameters (colors, dimensions, styles, etc)
* Export or save designs (if implemented)
* Responsive / mobile-friendly UI

(Add more specific features: e.g. “import SVG”, “download PNG”, “undo/redo”, etc.)

If you like, I can generate a ready-to-commit `README.md` for that repo and even update it with the live features and endpoints. Do you want me to push that draft into the repo (via a PR text) for you?
